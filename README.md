# Super Mario Bros Java Project

This project is made for CMPE114 Java project in a freshman year on TED University. This game has 3 levels, live-coin-score-timer system, mobs like goombas and koopas, pipes, main menu system, presentation mode system for restricting access to other levels and collision detection system which can be buggy sometimes.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. Most of the major changes normally won't be allowed since it is intended to showing the result of our school project. Improvements of it could be done in another branch someday.
